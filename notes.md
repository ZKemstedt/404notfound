# Notes taken during the course of project


# Minisprint - retrospective

At the start we were very confused about how to get started with items / tasks and user stories.
But all things considered I do believe we did very well.

Time estimation using ~~Party~~ Planning Poker of the first few tasks was influenced by the uncertainty of just how "big" a task was.
After some discussion we decided to break the items down into many very (very) small tasks
Once we got started with the sprint I felt like it was going very smoothly, this might be because the tasks we made were very small and we probably didn't do enouugh of them

I think we could have made more tasks.
